# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - In this section I need to go back and look at the difference between using `:` or `=>` in the hashes, also to see when quotations are needed for the keys. I was encountering errors before the CFU assignment, but did not encounter the same error after.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - I think I'm going to do a deep dive into all these pieces (hashes, methods, conditionals) and make notes about them all at once. It's going to be the best way for me to differentiate each piece of ruby and know how to refer to each one. Learning these sections one at a time has gotten me confused about their names, but I know what each do, separately.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - I try to solve problems myself, but I have been Googling things I have _no idea_ how to do. So I guess there's a difference. It saves me the time being completely stumped. When I need to fix things in situations I think the context of the assignment is usually enough to get me to the solution.
